# Sharp-for-bypass
Welcome to Sharp-for-bypass! This Python-based tool is a fork of the Sharp autoclicker, specifically designed to bypass screen share detection. With its unique feature to replace itself with an image, it ensures stealthy operation, making it virtually undetectable.

### Features
Self-Replace with Image: The core feature that allows the autoclicker to replace itself with a predefined image, ensuring it remains hidden during screen sharing.
Randomization: Introduces variability in clicking intervals to mimic human behavior and avoid detection.
Config System: It saves your clicker's config and load it when you execute sharp.
Right and Left Click: Supports both right and left mouse button clicks for versatile gameplay.
Click Only In-Game: Ensures clicks are registered only when Minecraft is active, preventing unintended clicks on other applications.
Do Not Click on Menus: Avoids interaction with menu elements to maintain focus on gameplay.
Break Blocks: Automatically clicks to break blocks in Minecraft, enhancing efficiency in resource gathering.
Hide Windows: Keeps the autoclicker window hidden to avoid detection during gameplay.
